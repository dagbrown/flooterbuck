Future ideas:

A modularized help system where each module is responsible for
generating its own help.  Maybe as well as scan() each module can
also define a help() subroutine or something.  

Get rid of the distinction between 'is' and 'are'. 

Make message_center work.

Stuff that never got fixed in infobot, and still needs to get fixed
here:

  - Make replacements work when they look like matching operators:
    "bot, foo =~ s/this /that/" should change "this " to "that",
    but instead makes bot look for a factoid matching "that" in
    the factoid with the key "foo =~ s/this" (I think --rich)

  - make "botnick, no, factoid is foo" equivalent to "no, botnick,
    factoid is foo". Requested by Sean "TorgoX" Burke.

  - Make 'seen' less precise when absences are long. (Does it matter if
    it's been a year and three seconds, or a year and eight?) (From
    Sean "TorgoX" Burke")

Fix this:
  
  <mendel> charlotte, is this broken?
  <mendel> what is charlotte,
  <charlotte> i think charlotte, is this broken?
